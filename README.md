**Physics-Based Movement**
- Custom glider physics with speed-dependent turning mechanics
- Realistic stall behavior and dive recovery systems
- Vector-based movement calculations with drag and acceleration modeling

**Proximity Detection Algorithm**
- Multi-ray collision detection system using 16-directional raycasting
- Real-time obstacle proximity calculation with weighted direction averaging
- BoxCast-based collision detection for improved accuracy

The prototype was intended to evaluate SuperFlight style game loop on Mobile phones
